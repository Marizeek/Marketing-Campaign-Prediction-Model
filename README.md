# Retail Marketing Campaign Prediction Models

**Overview**
This project focuses on building predictive models to determine the likelihood of customers subscribing to an Affinity Card as part of a retail marketing campaign. The models aim to assist businesses in making informed decisions by identifying potential subscribers, thus optimizing marketing strategies and resources.

**Project Structure**
The repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`Retail Marketing Campaign Prediction Models-Marizeek_Mabifa.ipynb`) that documents the entire process of creating and evaluating different predictive models. The notebook is structured as follows:

- **Introduction**: An overview of the project's goals and the significance of the Affinity Card variable.
- **Data Preparation**: Steps involved in preprocessing the data to make it suitable for model training. This includes data cleaning, feature selection, and data transformation.
- **Model Building & Deployment**: Detailed documentation of the development of various predictive models. This section explores different algorithms and their performance metrics.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparison of models based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to select the best-performing model for predicting Affinity Card subscription.

**Technologies Used**
- Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- Libraries: Various Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

**Getting Started**
To replicate the analysis or explore the models, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Retail Marketing Campaign Prediction Models-Marizeek_Mabifa.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment (e.g., JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook).
4. Run the cells in sequence to understand the process and results.
